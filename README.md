# Introduction

If you're developing PHP web application there maybe chance that you need to track users visit activities and base on some certain conditions and behavior to make necessary adjust in workflow. The simplest way to do this is via browser redirection header. 

With that need in mind, I wrote this simple library to use in many projects and want to share here

# Usage 

The library and integration is however at the moment not a fully working component, since it would depend on different situation and technologies, so I'd like to keep that open. 

# Extending

Just make a copy of this library and modify, extend it the way you like. I put an old but good version of the library here in this project.
